# ü§ñ LARP-AGI: The Most Advanced AGI Agent (Trust Me, Bro)

Welcome to LARP-AI, the cutting-edge artificial intelligence system that's definitely not just a bunch of if/else statements. Our revolutionary technology combines advanced string matching with random number generation to create the most sophisticated AI responses in the crypto space.

## üß† Core Technology

LARP-AI utilizes our proprietary RANDOM‚Ñ¢ (Really Advanced Neural Decision Orchestrating Mechanism) technology, powered by the revolutionary STRING.includes‚Ñ¢ architecture. Our dual-core processing system combines:

- RANDOM‚Ñ¢: Leveraging cutting-edge Math.random() calls to ensure maximum unpredictability
- STRING.INCLUDES‚Ñ¢: State-of-the-art string matching technology that literally checks if one string contains another string (patent pending)

This powerful combination allows us to achieve up to 100% accuracy in detecting when "gm" is indeed contained within "gm". Few understand this technology.

## üöÄ Features

- **Advanced Message Processing**: We check if strings include other strings. Revolutionary.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Currently supports Telegram (more coming never‚Ñ¢)
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Different responses for different keywords (we call this AGI)
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: We use .env files. Hackproof.

## üõ† Installation

1. Clone this definitely-not-a-meme repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgiDad/Larp-Agi-Core.git
```

2. Install dependencies (we use pnpm for maximum innovation):

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Start the future of AI:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## ü§ù Contributing

Want to contribute to the future of AI? Here's how:

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your galaxy-brain responses to `src/services/AGI/knowledge/index.ts`
3. Create a PR
4. Be amazed as your contribution becomes part of the most advanced AI system\*

\*Results may vary. Advanced AI system claim pending peer review.

### Response Categories

Currently supported categories in our neural network:

- `priceResponses`: For maximum price prediction LARPing (triggered by "price")
- `degenResponses`: Pure degen energy (default responses)
- `gmResponses`: Because saying GM is a lifestyle (triggered by "gm")
- `memeResponses`: For those who understand meme supremacy
- `aiResponses`: Sarcastic takes on AI and trading bots

Feel free to add new categories. The more random, the more advanced it becomes.

### Adding New Platforms

Want to add support for Discord, Slack, or your smart fridge? Here's how:

1. Create a new platform service in `src/platforms/` for your platform
2. Implement the `IPlatform` interface and use the `AgiService` for responses
3. Create a PR
4. Profit (not financial advice)

## üí∞ Grants

Want to earn some sweet LAI tokens? We're offering grants for meaningful contributions:

### Knowledge Base Expansion

- 100 LAI tokens for adding 40+ new quality responses
- Must be original, creative, and maintain the project's vibe
- PRs should include new strings in `src/services/AGI/knowledge/index.ts`

### Core Development

- 1000 LAI tokens for new platform integrations or core modules
- Must be fully functional and well-documented
- Code should follow existing patterns and include tests

### Requirements for All Grants

1. Follow our Twitter account (@LARP_AGI)
2. Star and Watch the main repository
3. Include in your PR:
   - Your Twitter handle
   - Solana wallet address
   - List of completed requirements
   - Brief description of your contribution

Note: All grants are subject to review and approval. Quality over quantity‚Äîwe can tell the difference between ChatGPT outputs and galaxy-brain content. Only one grant participation per GitHub / Twitter handle / wallet profile is allowed.

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

- [ ] Add more if/else statements
- [ ] Implement quantum random number generation (Math.random() but quantum)
- [ ] Support for more platforms (maybe)
- [ ] AGI singularity (ETA: 2 weeks)
- [ ] Add more cringe responses (infinite scaling)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is a parody project. Any resemblance to actual AI systems is purely coincidental and honestly quite concerning if true. Not financial advice. DYOR. Few understand.

## üìú License

ISC - Because we're decentralized like that.

## üôè Acknowledgments

Special thanks to:

- The random number generator
- String.prototype.includes()
- Coffee
- The blockchain (obviously)
- ChatGPT (for pretending to understand our genius)
